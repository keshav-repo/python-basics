1. Tuple: Python Tuple is a collection of objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a Python list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but the main difference between both is Python tuple is immutable, unlike the Python list which is mutable. \
    We can find items in a tuple since finding any item does not make changes in the tuple. \
    One cannot add items to a tuple once it is created. \
    Tuples cannot be appended or extended. \
    We cannot remove items from a tuple once it is created. 
2. Some of important feature of tuple which make it different from list \
   Tuples are more memory efficient than the lists. \
   When it comes to the time efficiency, tuples have a slight advantage over the lists especially when we consider lookup value. \
   If you have data that shouldnâ€™t change, you should choose tuple data type over lists. 
3. We can use negative index as in list to access variable 
4. Nesting tuple 
5. merging tiple: + operator is used to merge
