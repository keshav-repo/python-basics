What is a string. 
1. A string is a data structure in Python that represents a sequence of characters
2.  It is an immutable data type, meaning that once you have created a string, you cannot change it.

Important points about String
1. Single or double quotation is used to represent string
2. Multiline string can assigned using three doule quotes or three single quotes.
3. strings in python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters, so we can access
each element using bracket and giving 0 based index. 
4. 'in' keyword can be used to loop in character 
5. len is used to find the length of string 
6. in keyword used to check if a character or pharase is present in the string 
7. 'not in' keyword is used to check if a string in not present another string
8. Slicing - getting substring using colon. We can give either start,end index or give both. We can also use negative index here. 
9. Built in string method \
   i. upper() -> returns the string in upper case \
   ii. lower() -> returns the string in lower case \
   iii. strip() -> remove the white space if no argument is passed or the character we syecify
10. String concatination: can be achieved using + operator 
11. We can combine string and number using format method 
12. Adding double quotes if there is a quotes inside the string 
13.
