# Object Oriented Programming

1. Object oriented Programming: It is programming design/methodology that binds together data and function associated 
 with object.
2. OOPs Concepts: \
    Class \
    Objects \
3. Class: It is used defined data type. It consists of data and function. 
   Example: a) Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties. Function can be move forward, take 
   left etc. \
   b) Bulb  c) Dog  e) Employee
4. Object: Object is a instance of class 
5. dot(.) is used to access the properties of object.
5. Initializer: When we need to give our custom initialisation to object, we use initializer. __init__ is the method name 
   used to initialize object. 
6. We can give default Initializer to a argument. This way argument becomes optional. 
7. self: self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and 
    methods of the class in python. The first argument of every class method, including init, is always 
    a reference to the current instance of the class.  By convention, this argument is always named self. 
    In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, 
    it refers to the instance whose method was called.
8. class and instance variable: class variable is a variable of class. Every object in class will have same value for class 
   variable. Every object will have a seperate copy of instance variable. Instance variable are defined inside initializer. 
   It can be modified  inside instance parameter and using instances.
