1. List is used to store collection of data. 
2. List are created using square bracket 
```
languages = ["C", "C++", "Java", "Python", "Scala"]
```
3. We can use zero based indexing to access elements from list
4. When we add new element, it is adding in the last index
5. List is mutable and allow dublicate
6. Negative indexing will give element from last
7. Getting sublist using colon(:) symbol 
8. in keywork is used to check if a element exist in list
```
 if "Scala" in languages:
       print("Scala is present in language")
```  
9. Since list is immutable, we can change the value
10.
