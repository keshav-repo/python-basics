1. List is used to store collection of data. 
2. List are created using square bracket 
```
languages = ["C", "C++", "Java", "Python", "Scala"]
```
3. We can use zero based indexing to access elements from list
4. When we add new element, it is adding in the last index
5. List is mutable and allow dublicate
6. Negative indexing will give element from last
7. Getting sublist using colon(:) symbol 
8. in keywork is used to check if a element exist in list
```
 if "Scala" in languages:
       print("Scala is present in language")
```  
9. Since list is immutable, we can change the value
10. insert method insert at a particular position 
11. extend method add all element from another list
12. pop, pop(index) to pop element from list
13. clear() method 
14. Looping 
    i. using in operator \
    ii. using range \
    iii using while loop 
15. sorting using sort method of list 
16. Copy list: You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: 
    list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will
    automatically also be made in list2. Two inbuilt method to achieve this. 
    i. copy method \
    ii. list() method
17. Join list
    i. using + operator \
    ii. using append operator \ 
    iii. using extend operator
